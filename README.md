## 📖 Overview

The Cat Recognition Project leverages deep learning techniques to identify cats in images. This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for data preparation, neural network construction, model training, and evaluation.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess image data.
- **Model Building**: Construct neural networks with customizable layers.
- **Training**: Train models with different configurations and hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

## 💻 Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoomKh/cat_recognition_with_DeepLearning.git
cd cat_recognition_with_DeepLearning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to go through each step of the project:

```bash
